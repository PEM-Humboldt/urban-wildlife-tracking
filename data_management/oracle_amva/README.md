Here we describe how to store data in a Oracle database.
The Oracle database that we used is protected by several layers and you obviously can not connect...
However we hope that the R and SQL codes you'll find might help you if you use a similar setting.

Note that the Oracle setting from AMVA must be accessed though a VPN, which only work in Windows.
This setting does not allow a lot of flexibility, so it is difficult to render the document and to verify that everything works well.
So the code here is an example that must be carefully verified before applying.

If you plan to use SQL database to store and manage your wildlife tracking data, I would recommend a postgres/postgis database instead (see <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-03743-1>).
